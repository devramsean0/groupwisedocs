# An Overview
## The Mobile App
The mobile app is how you access immich from your phone, this guide covers post authentication/app setup but you can read about [that here](/immich/03-installing-the-app/)

### Seeing your photos
Once you open the app (called Immich) you will be greeted with a date sorted timeline of your photos.

Additionally along the bottom of the screen there are 4 icons:
- Photos (the page the app opens on)
- Search (the image search tool)
- Albums (the album management tool, we'll cover this later)
- Library (A page that allows you to manage your library)

You can access the combined photos from all your libraries through this page. The images show grouped by the day they were taken and you can scroll down through them.

Additionally, if you press on any individual photo you can enlarge it, which will also give you the ability to:
- Share the photo to any other apps on your phone
- Complete basic cropping and filtering using a set of presets
- Add an image to an album or archive it
- Delete the image, this lets you choose to delete it from your phone at the same time or leave it locally

### Search
The search page is quite simple, you just type what you want to find into the search box and then enter it.
It will then display an interface very similar to the photos page and pressing on the image works the same.

You can also search based on the person detection, model of the camera and date it was taken using the pill shaped buttons at the top of the page

### Albums
The albums page lets you see all the albums you have created as a user, additionally it lets you create them too. 

If you press on an album's name it lets you see all the images in the album.

Albums are like paper photo albums, and they allow you to organise your photos into folders, additionally an image can be part of multiple albums

### The Library
This page contains mainly advanced features that you are unlikely to need to use regularly.

It allows you to see:
- Any images you have favorited using the heart
- Any archived images
- Any "Shared link"
- Your recycle bin/trash
- Any people the face detection has recognised
- The places where you took your photos according to the metadata of the photo

I wont explain a lot of this since they are relatively advanced and self explanatory

## The Website
The website is how you see your library on a desktop computer. It is very similar to the android app and many of the features work the same.

The key differences are:
- The search page has moved to the bar at the top of the page
- The people list has moved to the Explore Page
- The map has moved to the map page

And in general all the buttons along the bottom of the page have moved to the left side bar

The website can also be installed as an app, which will allow you to pin it to the homepage.
On Microsoft Edge, this is done by pressing the "Install Immich App" button that appears for a short amount of time when you load the immich site in a new tab. this can then be pinned to your task bar or found in the Windows Start Menu
